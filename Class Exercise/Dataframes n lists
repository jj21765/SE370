#Lesson 11 - R nd RStudio Basics: Factors, DataFrames, and Lists
#SE370 19-2

######################################################################
#Lesson Objectives:
#1. Understand what a factor type is and how to use it
#2. Create, manipulate, and sort a dataframe
#3. Create and manipulate a list

#What is a factor?
?factor
## a way to categorize data, can order them by precedence (value?)

#create a vector called students of student performance  - A , B, B, C, D, F, A
students <- c("A","B","B","C","D","F","A")

#factor the vector and set the levels of the vector so that it is A > B > C > D > F
students <- factor(students, levels = c("F","D","C","B","A"),ordered = TRUE)

#find the summary of the vector
summary(students)

#load in the army_cars_small dataset as the variable "cars"
getwd()
cars <- read.csv('army_cars_small.csv')

#look at the first 6 rows of the dataframe
## we call this the head of the dataframe ##
head(cars)

#what kind of data are we working with? What is the structure?
str(cars)

#look at the makes using the $ notation
cars$make

#subset the dataframe on only toyota cars, save the variable to toyota

toyota <- subset(cars, cars$make == "TOYOTA")
#how many of each year group are there in the dataset? Save this as a variable toyota_years

toyota_years <- table(toyota$year)
toyota_years

#order your toyota dataframe by mileage
order(toyota$mileage)


#Did you get what you expect? How do you fix it?

#change the mileage variable to a numeric and try again
toyota$mileage <- as.numeric(toyota$mileage)
order(toyota$mileage)

#How good do you feel about this data?


#Combine the cars, toyota, and toyota years objects together into a list named car_list--- name each thing appropriately

car_list2 <- list(cars,toyota,toyota_years)
#CDT Lee, David gave verbal assistance in regards to what function to use to combine
#objects into a list 

#look at the structure of car_list
str(car_list2)

#now let's make a simple plot -- 
#considering just the toyota cars, make a plot that shows us something about the mileage.
#drop your plot into Teams (in the chat) then submit this .R file.
plot.default(toyota$year,toyota$mileage,panel.first = grid(10,10),
             pch = 0, cex = .5, col = "blue")
plot(toyota,toyota$mileage)

x <- toyota
y <- toyota$mileage
plot(x,y,main="Toyota Car Mileage")

plot(toyota$year,toyota$mileage)

#CDT Lee, David provided verbal assistance on what function to use to plot the toyotal mileage
