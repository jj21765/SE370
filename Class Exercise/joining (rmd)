1) Read in the TRANSCOM data and show the first 6 rows:


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
transcom <- read_csv("USTRANSCOM_DATA.csv")

head(transcom)
```


2) Read in the carrier data and show the first 6 rows:

```{r}
carrier <- read_csv("CARRIER_LIST.csv")

head(carrier)
```

3) Find the top 5 (known) carriers that sent the most (total) weight to or from AFRICOM. Show the result below:

```{r}
transcom_top <- transcom %>%
  filter(CARRIER != 'UNKNOWN') %>% 
  filter(SPOE_AOR == "AFRICOM" | SPOD_AOR == "AFRICOM") %>%
  group_by(CARRIER) %>%
  summarise(total_weight = sum(WEIGHT)) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  arrange(-total_weight)

transcom_top
```

4) Use a join to merge the carrier data with your result from the above question.  Show the result below:

```{r}
transcom_joined <- transcom_top %>%
  left_join(carrier, by = "CARRIER")

transcom_joined
```
